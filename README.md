# Window-Malware-Scanner
check malware file and remove it from system using virustotal
Windows Malware  Scanner[WMS] helps you scan suspicious files for malware .The scanner is integrated right into the Windows Context Menu so you can Scan the folder quickly.
## How will it be helpful?
Anti-virus softwares are great but at the same time are complicated to use and they hog a lot of memory.An average user wants something faster and lighter.WMS is capable of scanning over 500 files types(Be it an executable,a zip file,torrents or even an Image that you downloaded today) without slowing you down.Just left-click and the results appear instantly.
## How it Works?
Currently the scanner uses virustotal API to identify malware.When you run application to Scan a folder a lot is going on under the hood.The flowchart shown below puts it in simple words.

## How to Use?
Using the scanner is really simplified as this repo already contain ready to use Setups(created using [Cx Freeze](https://pypi.org/project/cx-Freeze/)). [Click here](https://github.com/thanhcongchien/Window-Malware-Scanner/tree/main/Ready%20to%20use%20Binaries) and download both the files.Install the installer(Make sure to install it in the default path) then extract the RAR and run the executable present inside it(This executable adds the program to windows context menu).Done!,now right click on any file and you should now be able to see the "WMS Scan" option there.
